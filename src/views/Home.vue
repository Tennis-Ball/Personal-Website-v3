  <div class="m-2 text-2xl font-extrabold">About Me</div>
  <p class="m-2 text-lg">
    I am a sophomore at Stanford Online High School who partakes in web
    development, contest math, and linux ricing. Ever since my first programming
    experience preparing for the USACO, I have explored into other fields in an
    attempt to find my niche.
    <br /><br />
    I am also a nationally ranked competitive fencer, as well as a hobbyist of
    boxing and basketball.
